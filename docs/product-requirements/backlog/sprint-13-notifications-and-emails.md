# Sprint 13: Notifications and Emails

## Description

Emails and online/platform notifications when I log in:- when I sign up
- when my device is linked
- when subscription is confirmed, renewed, or cancelled
- ...when payment processes (success or failure)
- ....Missed call summary/digest
- ...Device is offline
- Profile updates
Other edge cases: what if they entered the address wrong and they need to edit before the device ships? What if the device is lost in transit? What if the user moves before delivery? What if they get the device but never activateAny users who create an account but don't complete checkout are warm leads. We also shouldn't let them go cold. So we should also think about abandoned cart recovery and possibly even reminders. For example:- One hour after they bounce we could send them an email saying &#34;You're one step away from giving X a companion.&#34;
- Second reminder could be 24 hours from then and we could send a final nudge in 72 hours.
We could figure out the effective timing for that.
