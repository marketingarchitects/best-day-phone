# Design Guidelines — Best Day Phone

When working on HTML/CSS prototypes in this directory, follow these design principles:

## Visual Direction

- **Tone:** Warm, human, not clinical
- **Colors:** Warm cream backgrounds (#FDF8F3), rich accent colors (burgundy #722F37, forest green #228B22)
- **Typography:** Elegant serif for headlines (e.g., Playfair Display), clean sans for body (e.g., Inter, Source Sans)
- **Photography:** Real people, authentic moments, warm lighting
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace, let it breathe

## UI Principles

- Large, readable text (16px+ body, 24px+ headlines)
- High contrast for accessibility
- Simple, obvious interactions
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Avoid

- Cold, clinical blues
- Small text or dense layouts
- Complex multi-step flows
- Technical jargon in UI copy
