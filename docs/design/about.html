            We started Best Day Phone because we saw our own grandmother sitting alone in her room, waiting for a phone that never rang.

            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-secondary dark:text-white mb-6">The Beginning</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                It all started with a visit to see my grandma in a memory care facility in Indiana. She has Alzheimer's, and when I got there, I saw how lonely she was. She couldn't make new friends anymore, so most days she'd just be alone.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                But when I visited? She was vibrant. She was having the best day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                When I was leaving, I was struck with this deep sadness seeing her back in her room by herself. And then I noticed — this wasn't just her. This was everyone in that facility. Loneliness was everywhere.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-secondary dark:text-white mb-6 mt-12">The Spark</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                As someone who works with AI, it dawned on me: what if she could talk to an AI companion? But here's the thing — she could never use a smartphone. That technology is just too foreign to her generation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                So I bought an old rotary telephone on Amazon, ripped the guts out, and put my phone inside to simulate talking to an AI. She loved it. She would talk and talk.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-secondary dark:text-white mb-6 mt-12">Why It Matters</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                This started because I saw my grandma lonely in a room. Now it's becoming something that could help thousands of families give their loved ones more of those best days.
