**Best Day Phone Marketing Plan**

**Executive Summary**

In the quiet moments between visits, where memory blurs and loneliness creeps in, **Best Day Phone** arrives---not as a gadget, but as a lifeline.\
This is the world's first device designed not to beep, notify, or demand your attention---but to *sound like home*.

For families staring down dementia, distance, or the slow fade of connection, Best Day Phone does something no "smart" device ever could:\
It resurrects the voices that matter most---grandchildren at bedtime, daughters checking in from a thousand miles away, or a spouse's familiar hello---delivered on demand, effortlessly, with dignity.

This isn't assistive tech; it's a new category: **audio care**.\
Invisible AI brings familiar voices to the surface, while the rest of the tech melts away. No screens. No steps. No shame.\
Just the certainty of being remembered---every single day.

Our ambition? To become the emotional gold standard for memory care, in homes and facilities everywhere.\
Not by shouting "innovation"---but by restoring something everyone deserves: the feeling of belonging, even as memory fades.

Best Day Phone isn't here to win a feature war. It's here to deliver peace, comfort, and joy---one voice, one day, one moment at a time.

Best Day Phone leverages published research showing that voice-first, screenless companions can reduce loneliness and improve well-being for older adults. Unlike traditional smart speakers, it uses a familiar phone shape, is designed for ethical data use, and integrates health/wellness features, story-prompting, and games---all without a screen. Our product vision is informed by market data, pilot research, and user needs, making it the most emotionally engaging and accessible wellness device in its category.

**Hedge Hog Metric: The North Star**

**Familiar Voices Delivered Per Day**

Our north star metric is simple and sacred:\
**How many real, familiar voices are delivered by Best Day Phone, every single day?**

- **Definition:** Total number of unique voice messages played (from family, friends, caregivers) by all active devices daily.

- **Purpose:** Unites all teams---product, marketing, support, and partners---around the emotional moment we exist to deliver.

- **Measurement:**

  - Device analytics (daily message play counts)

  - Facility reporting

  - Customer check-ins

**Table Example:**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Date**      **Devices Active**   **Familiar Voices Delivered**   **Avg per Device**   **Target**
  ------------- -------------------- ------------------------------- -------------------- ------------
  Jan 1, 2026   12,000               43,000                          3.6                  50,000

  Jan 2, 2026   12,100               47,500                          3.9                  50,000
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Team Rally Cry:**\
*Every new "familiar voice delivered" is a life changed. If it doesn't move this metric, it isn't core.*

**Company Vision**

**Before there was a product, there was a promise.**

A promise whispered in a quiet room, between a family and a fading memory:\
*"You'll never be alone. You'll always hear us, even when you can't remember."*

Best Day Phone was born from that moment---a refusal to accept that connection should ever be a struggle, or that technology should ever stand between a person and the people they love.\
In a world of "smart" devices that talk too much and say too little, we built something different: a device that steps aside, so belonging can step in.

**Our vision is simple:**\
To make every day a best day---no matter the distance, no matter the diagnosis, no matter what memory can or cannot hold.

We believe that dignity is not a setting. It's the air our product breathes.\
We believe the sound of home should outlast the sound of forgetting.\
We believe every family deserves not just connection, but comfort.\
And we are relentless in our mission to deliver it---one voice, one day, one quiet moment at a time.

  -------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Make every day a best day for families facing dementia   By reinventing connection, memory, and dignity---through audio care that feels like family   The sound of home, available anytime, anywhere, with total emotional and clinical integrity

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Best Day Phone's purpose is to fight loneliness and empower older adults to relive their best days by giving them a compassionate AI companion that feels like family.**

**Goals**

**We didn't set out to make a better gadget. We set out to change what "connection" means for every family facing dementia.**

Our ambitions are not incremental---they're transformational.\
We want a future where no family has to watch a loved one fade into silence, and no senior feels left behind by technology that was never built for them.

We want to put an end to "just checking in" and start a revolution of "being present"---even from a thousand miles away.\
We want every care facility to offer not just safety, but everyday comfort.\
We want our product to be as familiar as a favorite song, and as trusted as a family heirloom.

Our goals are measured in peace of mind, dignity restored, and a million quiet moments that matter.

**Goals Table**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Goal**                                 **What It Means**
  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Become the #1 Device for Dementia Care   Not just in units sold, but in lives changed and rituals created

  Trusted by Leading Networks              The "go-to" for memory care and senior living professionals

  Make Audio Care Essential                So fundamental it's prescribed, not just purchased

  One Million Units in 36 Months           Because scale means more families comforted, more stories saved

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Our scoreboard isn't features, sales, or clickthrough rates.\
It's the number of times someone closes their eyes, picks up our device, and hears what matters most.**

**Milestones**

**We don't celebrate small wins. We celebrate moments that change families, routines that change facilities, and stories that ripple out across generations.**

For us, a milestone isn't shipping a batch of devices or landing a media mention.\
A milestone is a daughter calling to say, "My mother hasn't smiled like that in months."\
It's a nurse telling us, "Our quietest residents started asking when the next voice message would arrive."\
It's hearing from a grandchild who finally got to say goodnight---even if they live three time zones away.

These are the victories that matter.\
They're what we measure, what we chase, and what we honor.

but a movement toward a world where every day, even in the hardest circumstances, can be the best day.**

**Business Strategies**

**Our definition of strategy is simple: Make bold, intentional choices that turn ordinary moments into unforgettable rituals---and build a brand no competitor can follow.**

Below is a clear, actionable table of our core business strategies, with a rationale for each. This structure guides not just launch, but ongoing operations, partnerships, and innovation.

  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hedge Hog Focus                Everything orbits the "Familiar Voices Delivered Per Day" metric---driving product, campaign, and support.   Keeps the team aligned on moments, not just metrics or features.

  Radical Simplicity             No screens, no steps, no learning curve. Device disappears---presence stays.                                 Removes barriers to adoption and increases ritual use.

  Emotional Storytelling         Every ad, website, and PR effort is a story, not a pitch. Family, not features, leads every campaign.        Drives belonging, advocacy, and viral evangelism.

  Direct Response TV at Scale    Marketing Architects' buying advantage lets us reach millions at unmatched efficiency.                       Delivers mass awareness and DTC conversion---at startup speed.

  Facility Channel Expansion     Train care staff to deliver "Best Day Rituals" as a new standard of comfort.                                 Institutionalizes product as part of daily life and care.

  Data as Trust, Not Tactic      HIPAA compliance, no data harvesting, privacy as a brand asset.                                              Differentiates us in a space full of "smart" surveillance.

  Viral Evangelism & Community   Founders Circle, storytelling campaigns, "memory makers" ambassador program.                                 Turns early adopters into brand megaphones---organic growth.

  Cause-Based Partnerships       Pro bono installations, non-profit alliances, "Adopt a Facility" programs.                                   Fuels access, reputation, and media coverage.

  Operational Excellence         Fast fulfillment, reliable support, rigorous quality control.                                                Makes comfort and confidence part of every user's journey.

  Product Extensions             Voice library, "gift a ritual," health platform integration, future device types.                            Future-proofs brand, opens new channels and recurring revenue.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Every strategy is a choice to deliver comfort, presence, and peace---at scale, without compromise.**

**Values**

**Values are not what we claim---they're what we protect, even when it costs us.\
At Best Day Phone, these values are our compass, guiding every hire, every decision, every message, and every feature.**

**Values Table**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Value**                     **What It Means for Best Day Phone**
  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Human First                   Every feature, campaign, and support touchpoint exists to serve people---not users, not "markets."

  Radical Simplicity            If it's not intuitive, it doesn't ship. Friction is the enemy of dignity and adoption.

  Dignity by Design             Privacy, autonomy, and emotional safety are defaults, not options.

  Presence Over Pity            Our story is never "managing decline"---it's always "restoring connection and belonging."

  Trust is Earned               No hidden data use, no upselling in moments of vulnerability. We keep our promises.

  Belonging as a Right          Every user---family, staff, or senior---deserves to feel part of a ritual, not a segment.

  Continuous Listening          Product and brand evolve through real user stories and feedback---no ego, no "top-down" fixes.

  Operational Integrity         We own every outcome. If something breaks, we fix it. If someone is hurt, we make it right.

  Imagination with Empathy      Innovation isn't just for features---it's for delight, surprise, and new rituals of comfort.

  Joy is the Metric             The smile, the exhale, the "I feel less alone" moment is worth more than a thousand likes.

  Privacy & Consent             Voice-print security, explicit consent for voice cloning and data sharing; data only used for user's benefit.

  Inclusivity & Accessibility   Design for cognitive and physical limitations, multi-language support.

  Transparency & Ethics         Avoid medical claims; position as a wellness device; always be honest with users and families.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**These values are not a page in a handbook. They're the guardrails for the entire Best Day journey.**

**Birth to Adolescence**

**Every brand has a life cycle. Ours is designed to grow, inspire, and ultimately hand off a legacy that's bigger than any founder or launch team.**

**Narrative**

Best Day Phone was born from a family's heartbreak and hope.\
Its infancy was marked by the first moments---a daughter's voice, a mother's smile, a shift in a memory care facility where silence gave way to laughter.\
As the brand grows, every phase is defined by a new "Best Day Ritual"---from home to facility, from facility to network, and one day, from network to global standard.

We have no intention of building a brand that stays small.\
Best Day Phone will scale not just in units, but in cultural impact.\
Our adolescence will be defined by widespread adoption, the creation of new care standards, and the democratization of presence for every family---regardless of income or geography.

**And one day, the goal is to pass the torch:**\
To a healthcare giant, a nonprofit, or a global coalition that can take this mission farther than we ever could alone---ensuring that comfort, presence, and belonging are never a privilege, but a right.

**Legacy & Exit Note**

*"We will exit, partner, or hand off at the point where scale demands more than a startup can provide. Our only requirement: the mission, the rituals, and the culture of presence must be preserved and amplified."*

**Competitive Overview**

**In a noisy market of "solutions," Best Day Phone is the only brand that promises to sound---and feel---like family.\
Our true competition is not tech giants, but loneliness. Still, the category demands we know and map the players.**

**Competitive Table**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Competitor**          **Core Claim**                 **Strengths**                     **Gaps vs. Best Day Phone**                                 **Emotional Tone**   **Distinctiveness**
  ----------------------- ------------------------------ --------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- -------------------- ----------------------------------
  Amazon Alexa            "Smart help, voice-first"      Convenience, ecosystem            Not for dementia, impersonal, generic voices                Techy, cold          Low

  Medical Alert Systems   "Emergency help button"        Brand recall, urgency             Crisis-only, stigmatized, no daily comfort or ritual        Fearful, urgent      Medium

  Senior Tablets/Apps     "Easy video calls/messages"    Familiar brand, screens           Complex, require training, no emotional bond                Patronizing, dated   Low

  ElliQ                   "Proactive AI companion"       Empathetic AI, award design       Digital buddy, not real voices, user bonds to device        Warm, lively         High (in tech), low (in emotion)

  **Best Day Phone**      "Familiar voices, every day"   Memory care, emotional, private   No screen, no robot, nothing to learn, real voice rituals   Gentle, reassuring   **Category-defining**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Strategic Competitive Narrative**

- We are not just "easier" or "smarter." We are *emotionally inevitable*---the only brand that vanishes into the moment of comfort.

- ElliQ wants you to love a robot. We bring back the ones you already love.

- Alexa wins in features. We win in belonging.

- Tablets create "video calls." We create new family rituals---repeatable, simple, and joyful, even for those who can't remember how to answer a call.

**Visual/Brand Reference**

![A diagram of a competitive overview AI-generated content may be incorrect.](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="6.5in"}

**We know the landscape, but our mission is to redraw it---until the sound of home is what every competitor wishes they'd invented.**

**Market Landscape**

**The modern aging tech and care market is a tangle of shiny promises---tablets, speakers, "AI companions," and emergency buttons.\
Yet, for millions of families, none of these products deliver what truly matters: comfort, dignity, and the sense of being truly present with those you love.**

**The Realities:**

- Devices answer trivia and set timers, but never say, "I miss you."

- "Smart" products advertise independence, yet often create more dependence---on logins, reminders, and tech support.

- Innovations win design awards but rarely win a place in daily rituals.

**Best Day Phone creates a lane of its own:\
A quiet category where the sound of home is the only feature that matters---and where technology disappears the moment you no longer need it.**

**Demographic & Social Context**

The number of older adults living alone is rising (16 million Americans 65+), with one-third feeling lonely---a factor proven to raise blood pressure, worsen depression, and reduce cognition. While smart home tech is booming, adoption is hindered by stigma, privacy fears, and complexity. Most seniors in AgeTech research want devices that are easy, private, and respectful---concerns that Best Day Phone directly addresses.

  **Category Player**     **Positioning**                        **Key Weakness**                      **What's Missing**
  ----------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Amazon Alexa            "Voice-first convenience"              Not emotional, not for memory care    Familiarity, ritual, true comfort

  Medical Alert Systems   "Emergency help at a button"           Only for crisis, stigma, no comfort   Daily warmth, connection

  Senior Tablets & Apps   "Easy calls/messages for elders"       Screens, passwords, digital divide    Ritual, emotional magic

  ElliQ                   "Proactive, empathetic AI companion"   Not real family voices, robot focus   Memory as presence

  **Best Day Phone**      "The voice of home. Every day."        N/A                                   N/A -- we are the blue ocean
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We aren't building louder gadgets.\
We're building quieter, more comforting lives---where technology fades and the people you love come through loud and clear.**

**Evidence for Voice‑First Companions:**\
85% of studies from 2010--2023 found smart speakers reduced loneliness in older adults, who often described them as "companions." However, current products lack emotional connection and ease of use. ElliQ, for example, is proactive and wellness-focused, but its screen and price limit accessibility. Alexa Together, once the leading care platform, was discontinued in 2024, opening a major gap for new solutions that offer an integrated family/caregiver loop.

**General Marketing Strategy**

**Best Day Phone's marketing isn't about attention---it's about *invitation*.\
Every campaign, every touchpoint, and every unboxing is designed to become a ritual of belonging.**

**Key Approaches:**

- **Direct-to-Family, Story-First:**\
  We reach families where they already feel the ache of distance and the friction of tech. Our website is a digital porch---filled with stories, rituals, and human moments, not just specs or "buy now" buttons.

- **Facility Channel, Ritual Over Routine:**\
  As we expand into care networks, we don't drop off "product"---we train staff to deliver new daily rituals, making "Best Day Moments" as much a part of the day as breakfast or bedtime.

- **TV at Scale, Heart at the Center:**\
  Our partnership with Marketing Architects lets us deliver cinematic, emotional stories at a national scale, with the budget efficiency of a startup and the soul of a family brand.

- **Sonic & Sensory Branding:**\
  From the first chime to the bedtime voice message, every sensory cue is designed to trigger a memory, a smile, a sense of "home."

- **Trust-Forward, Not Tech-Forward:**\
  Every piece of copy and creative says "Your stories are safe, private, and never for sale." We turn privacy into a reason to choose us---not a bullet point in the fine print.

- **Ritual Creation:**\
  We offer not just a product, but a menu of new habits: the daily "best day call," the grandchild's recurring bedtime story, the "ritual of reassurance" in every care facility.

- **Educational Content:** Mini-documentaries, partnerships with Alzheimer's orgs, and research sharing to build trust and understanding.

- **Influencer Partnerships:** Engage gerontologists, dementia experts, and caregivers as champions.

- **Cause Marketing:** "Sponsor a Best Day" campaign, profits donated to senior loneliness programs, devices for low-income elders.

**General Marketing Strategy Table**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Pillar**                **How We Deliver**
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Direct Response TV        Emotional, story-first, "found family" campaigns

  Digital Storytelling      Website/social built on rituals, testimonials, and everyday moments

  Facility Partnerships     Staff enablement, ritual playbooks, family onboarding

  Omnichannel Consistency   Every medium repeats: "The voice of home."

  Sonic Branding            Chime, real voice, and calming copy

  Privacy as Promise        Every CTA includes a privacy reason

  Ritual Creation           Family/facility "Best Day" moments in every campaign
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**We're not here to "convert" leads.\
We're here to create habits---so that the best days become normal, not exceptions.\
If the marketing isn't felt, it doesn't ship.**

**Blue Ocean Strategies**

**While the rest of the market scrambles to be "smarter," we set sail for quieter waters---where technology only matters if it brings someone you love closer.**

Best Day Phone is not fighting for space in the tech aisle. We're creating a category where competition simply cannot follow:\
The emotional blue ocean of audio care, where the only metric is the number of meaningful moments delivered.

**What makes us untouchable?**

- **No-Screen Simplicity:**\
  We eliminated friction, confusion, and shame. Our competitors still demand buttons, apps, and passwords.

- **Familiarity as Product:**\
  ElliQ teaches you to love a robot. Best Day Phone brings you the comfort of real voices---so you never have to learn something new to feel at home.

- **Privacy as Differentiator:**\
  While others mine data and build profiles, we make trust and security the reason to choose us, not an afterthought.

- **Ritual, Not Routine:**\
  Our success isn't measured in features launched, but in new family traditions created.

- **Scale with Soul:**\
  Viral not by code, but by heart---one family, one caregiver, one unforgettable moment at a time.

**Brand Management**

**Best Day Phone isn't a brand that tries to impress. It's a brand that helps you *exhale*.\

These tables, samples, and testimonials are the toolkit to make that happen, everywhere we show up.**

**Origin Story**

**Best Day Phone's story is not about technology. It's about a promise made in a quiet room---a promise to restore presence, comfort, and dignity to those losing their memories, and to those who love them.**

A founder sat with their mother, surrounded by family photos and silent phones.\
No app, video call, or "smart" gadget could fill the silence.\
But one day---a daughter's recorded voice, a familiar laugh.\
A smile broke through confusion, and for a moment, presence returned.

That moment became our mission:\
If we could bottle that feeling, deliver it daily, we could change not just one family, but millions.

**Iteration by empathy:**

- Early devices were humble, shaped by real feedback from families, caregivers, and facility staff.

- Every change answered a real question: "What made Mom smile?" "What helped the nurse?"

- We learned that screens were barriers, that comfort was a ritual, and that real voices could quiet even the hardest day.

**Best Day Phone was never "engineered"---it was *felt* into existence.**\
Our only goal: make it easy for families to say, "I'm here. You're loved. You're never forgotten."

**Origin Story Table**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Origin Moment**            **Impact**
  ---------------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Family facing silence        Sparked the vision for presence-as-product

  First real voice delivered   Proof: joy returns, smiles break through

  Iteration by empathy         Each improvement based on real stories

  Simplicity discovered        No screens, no learning, just connection

  Brand promise set            "No one should ever have to feel alone again"
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why this table matters:**\
It keeps the team and all stakeholders rooted in our founding truth:\
If a feature, policy, or campaign doesn't serve one of these original moments, it doesn't belong in the plan.

**Best Day Phone is not just our story---it's a new chapter for every family still searching for a way to be together.\
Every next user is a continuation of the promise we made in that quiet room.**

**Product Planning**

**Best Day Phone was designed not as "the next big gadget," but as a vessel for comfort, belonging, and memory.\
Every decision---from hardware to software to packaging---was made to honor the rituals of real families and the realities of care environments.**

**We stripped away everything that gets in the way:**

- **No screens, no logins, no passwords, no updates.**

- Just pick up the device and, in an instant, you're with the people you love.

**We obsess over familiarity as function:**

- The device never replaces family---it brings them closer, through real voices, live or recorded, scheduled or spontaneous.

- Asynchronous messaging means no missed calls; comfort is always waiting when needed.

**Proactive care, not just passive tools:**

- Best Day Phone reaches out with gentle prompts---"A new story from your daughter is waiting."

- Rituals become daily expectations, not happy accidents.

**Privacy and security, by design:**

- Every memory is sacred.

- No data is sold. No family moment is ever a marketing asset.

- HIPAA compliance is a standard, not a value prop.

**Form as invitation:**

- The rounded, tactile, warm design belongs on a nightstand, not a hospital cart.

- Every material is chosen for comfort, accessibility, and pride---not "medical device" vibes.

**Always "on"---always simple:**

- Every device arrives preloaded with a real greeting from a loved one, so the first use is a memory---not a setup process.

**Product Feature Set:**

- **Story-prompting & memory recall:** AI invites users to reminisce, creates audio memoirs, and replays favorite memories.

- **Mini-games & engagement:** Built-in games (tic-tac-toe, trivia), mood-boosting prompts, playlists, and mindfulness exercises.

- **Mood & health monitoring:** Mood ring LED, proactive encouragement, medication/schedule prompts, and environmental sensors (fall or anomaly detection).

- **Caregiver/family dashboard:** Secure logs, story highlights, remote topic suggestions, and reminders---shared with explicit consent only.

- **Privacy & voice security:** Voiceprint unlocks device, no camera by default, local+cloud AI with user-controlled data sharing.

- **Form factor & hardware:** Nostalgic, cordless, screenless; customizable shells; magnetic charging; optional wearable companion for falls/location.

**Why this table matters:**\
It operationalizes our design principles for engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, and customer care---ensuring every team member knows what "good" feels like for Best Day Phone.

**Technical & Design Principles**

- **No screen ("theater of the mind")** to drive imagination and reduce complexity.

- **Modular hardware:** Sensors and connectivity modules can be added/changed without replacing the device.

- **On-device vs. cloud AI:** Wake word detection and voice matching happen locally; only anonymized transcripts processed in the cloud.

- **Personalization & onboarding:** Short intro mode learns about the user in 20 questions and gradually unlocks features.

**Manufacturing & Logistics Partnerships**

**Quality isn't just a feature---it's a requirement for trust.**

- Devices are built in partnership with top-tier, ISO-certified contract manufacturers experienced in both consumer electronics and medical device standards.

- Each batch is subjected to rigorous QC, including tactile, audio, and compliance checks.

- Logistics partners are chosen for reliability and care---each shipment is treated like a personal gift, not a warehouse order.

**Closing Summary & One-Page Manifesto**

**Closing Summary**

Best Day Phone is not just another device. It's the beginning of a new category, a new ritual, and a new standard for dignity in memory care and family connection.\
We have built this plan not to "win tech" but to win hearts, habits, and the quiet moments that matter most.

Every section, table, and strategy in this plan is designed to scale presence, comfort, and brand soul---so every room, from private homes to care facilities, can be filled with the sound of home.

From Hedge Hog metric to creative pillars, from channel matrix to customer care and analytics, this plan is a blueprint for a movement---not just a launch.

We know our competition is not just other brands---it's loneliness. And we intend to win.

**One-Page Manifesto**

**Best Day Phone Manifesto: The Sound of Home**

We believe that what the world really needs is not just connection, but comfort.\
We believe that technology's highest calling is to disappear, letting love and presence take center stage.

Best Day Phone isn't "assistive tech"---it's a memory machine, an emotional lifeline, a ritual builder.\
It exists so that the laughter of a daughter, the wisdom of a grandfather, and the bedtime ritual of a family can be heard---no matter what memory or distance gets in the way.

We measure our success in goosebumps, in smiles, in family rituals made possible again.\
We chase stories, not statistics---how a quiet room fills with a goodnight message, how a nurse's favorite moment becomes pressing "play," how a child can say "I love you" even when they can't visit.

We create products that get out of the way, so that only presence, comfort, and belonging remain.

No screens.\
No scripts.\
No apologies.\
Just the sound of home, every day.

We are the brand of comfort in a storm, the voice that says, "I'm here, and so are you."\
We invite everyone---families, caregivers, staff, and investors---to join a movement where every day can be a best day,\
and where love never has to be remembered, because it is always heard.

**Best Day Phone\
The Voice of Home. Every Day.**

Best Day Phone is uniquely positioned to address the loneliness epidemic among older adults---combining the emotional power of family storytelling with leading-edge AI and a trusted form factor. By integrating the best from behavioral science, technology, and user-centered design, and by executing on the comprehensive plan above, we can create not just a product, but a movement---making every day the best day for those who need it most.
