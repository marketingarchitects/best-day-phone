**The Best Day Phone Story**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Beginning**

It all started with a visit to see my grandma in a memory care facility in Indiana. She has Alzheimer\'s, and when I got there, I saw how lonely she was. She couldn\'t make new friends anymore, so most days she\'d just be alone.

But when I visited? She was vibrant. She was having the best day.

When I was leaving, I was struck with this deep sadness seeing her back in her room by herself. And then I noticed---this wasn\'t just her. This was everyone in that facility. Loneliness was everywhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Spark**

As someone who works with AI, it dawned on me: what if she could talk to an AI companion? But here\'s the thing---she could never use a smartphone. That technology is just too foreign to her generation.

So I bought an old rotary telephone on Amazon, ripped the guts out, and put my phone inside to simulate talking to an AI. She loved it. She would talk and talk.

There\'s a mountain of research showing that regular conversation is good for people with dementia and Alzheimer\'s. I knew then I was onto something.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Building the First Prototype**

I got a Raspberry Pi and coded up a simple voice agent that could talk to my grandma. With a lot of help from ChatGPT, I wired it into the rotary shell I\'d gutted.

I gave it to my grandma, and she started using it constantly---an average of 2.5 hours per day. That\'s more than the average person spends on Facebook.

Soon I started getting calls from family members telling me how much she loved it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Taking It Further**

I talked to Chuck and told him I wanted to show him my prototype. Together, we took it to Whiteboard, a third-party prototype development firm.

We pitched them the idea, and they were excited to partner with us. Ethan from Whiteboard and I started working on more robust prototypes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Iterations**

We ran into challenges along the way:

On version one, the phone worked on some outlets but wouldn\'t turn on with others. We upgraded the power supply.

On version two, everything worked, but some people couldn\'t hear the AI even at max volume. So we built in an amplifier and volume controls.

For version three, I did some fieldwork---visiting memory care facilities across the country in Clarksville, Evansville, New York, and Las Vegas. I discovered that 40% of these facilities don\'t have WiFi in patient rooms.

So on revision three, we\'re building in onboard 5G connectivity. Users won\'t need to configure any network settings. They can just use it right out of the box.

I also met with Brett DiDonato to help build a custom board for the device.

Now we\'re working with our partners to produce 20 robust prototypes for broader user testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What\'s Next**

First, we\'re launching the main site with products listed as sold out---just to capture emails and build our waitlist for lead generation.

Then we\'re making a commercial to drive people to the site and collect emails for the official launch.

After that, Jon V will review the user experience I\'ve built so far and identify optimizations for onboarding and the user journey.

Finally, Alex and Andy will redesign the landing page based on Jon\'s feedback.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why It Matters**

This started because I saw my grandma lonely in a room. Now it\'s becoming something that could help thousands of families give their loved ones more of those best days.

Want me to turn this into a presentation deck or make any adjustments to the tone or length?
