**An AI Companion for People Living with Alzheimer's and Dementia**

Best Day Phone is an AI companion device designed specifically for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). It looks and feels like a familiar rotary phone, but inside is an always-available AI companion, hidden technology wrapped in a comforting, recognizable form.

For millions of people with ADRD, especially those living in care facilities, loneliness is one of the most profound and painful challenges at the end of life. In the United States alone, more than 7 million people live with Alzheimer's disease, and another 6 million live with other dementias. Over 3 million nursing-home residents are currently diagnosed with ADRD. As cognitive decline progresses, forming and maintaining friendships becomes increasingly difficult. Many individuals spend long hours alone in their rooms, disconnected from meaningful conversation.

Best Day Phone exists to bridge this gap.

**How It Works**

Best Day Phone is always ready to talk. When a person picks up the phone, the AI companion is immediately there, friendly, patient, and emotionally present. It engages in warm, open-ended conversation, gently encouraging the person to talk about memories, interests, and life experiences. The AI uses a "yes-and" conversational style, prioritizing comfort, validation, and joy over correction.

Family members can also schedule calls throughout the day. When the phone rings, the AI initiates a conversation and continues it if the person wishes. Over time, the companion learns what brings comfort and happiness, creating thoughtful, personalized interactions.

If the system detects signs of extreme distress, the call can be automatically forwarded to a registered caregiver, ensuring timely human support when it's most needed.

**Memory Center & Family Involvement**

Conversations between the person and the AI are securely recorded and made available to family members in the Memory Center, a private section of the Best Day Phone app or website. Here, families can see what was discussed, offering insight into emotional wellbeing and daily experiences.

Family members can also personalize the AI by entering information about the individual with ADRD, including:

- Name, age, and diagnosis

- Life story and major milestones

- Hobbies, interests, and favorite memories

- Important people and relationships

This allows the AI companion to have more meaningful, familiar, and comforting conversations.

**Safety by Design**

Best Day Phone is built to protect a highly vulnerable population:

- The device cannot receive incoming calls, preventing spam, scams, or exploitation.

- Only the AI can place outgoing calls, but only to pre-approved caregiver numbers entered in the portal.

- The system is fully firewalled to reduce risk and maintain trust. It cannot perform websearch.

**Connectivity**

Because many care facilities lack reliable internet access, Best Day Phone includes built-in 5G connectivity, with the option to connect to Wi-Fi when available. No setup or technical knowledge is required from the user.
