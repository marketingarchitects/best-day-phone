**[Next Step Opportunities]{.underline}**

- Understanding the competitive landscape

  - Wellness products and consumer

  - Regulatory process

    - North American and Global

- Establish Strategic Framing

  - What is the category?

  - Name, Frame, and Claim

  - Want a villain for the category:

    - Loneliness → We solve loneliness

    - Memory Loss

  - What do we stand against?

  - Regulatory (Class 2 vs consumer) leaning to Class 2 (6 years)

    - Consumer plan or Healthcare plan (Healthcare more of a barrier)

    - Consumer launch version and Healthcare launch version (Must Haves)

      - Are there other products that have started consumer and turned healthcare

      - Wellness products (Chuck has checklist)

    - Healthcare quality programs

    - Can we find a predicate

    - What could go wrong? (1 in 500,000)

      - Put it in your bathtub

      - Psychologically vs physically potential issues

      - Regulatory process should take care of this

  - No structure/function claims

    - If you can win without a claim, it's even better

  - Drive with emotional attachment

- Establish: Alzheimer Advisory Board

- Design & Build: 20-100 prototypes

  - Define features (must haves, could haves, will not haves)

    - Sketches with feature sets

  - Concept Exploration of Form Factor

  - Prototype

    - Purpose of live market test

    - Test with friends and family

- Design & Create Life Log

  - Read dialog and listen to features

  - Mood Recognition Feature

- Study: 30--40 participants over 6 weeks

- Timeline: TBD

- IP consideration (protection and infringement)

- Chuck's Initial Feedback

  1.  We should keep the device focused on conversation/dialogue/audio focused. 

  2.  Our COGS should be as low as possible as we will keep the technology in the cloud.

  3.  Do we build an ecosystem product of ideas around our core idea? TBD.

  4.  What other technology, like lidar, could be cost efficiently embedded?

  5.  What designs should we consider for the core phone?

  6.  Do we embed a cell device plan? Backup processing on the chip of Wi-Fi is down?

      - Is there a backup mode?

  7.  And do these questions change if we choose other targets, like children?
