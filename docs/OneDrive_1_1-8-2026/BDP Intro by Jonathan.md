Jonathan Elfreich's Best Day Phone
Introduction
Misfits & Machines All Team Meeting

“So this is the best, worst-kept secret of the entire year, I think. Almost all of you I have talked
to or pitched the idea of the Best Day Phone in some capacity, but it's finally going to be
officially a project that we're all going to get to work together on. So, I wanted to actually take
you guys through the story of the Best Day Phone, because some of you guys heard my original
pitch. Some of you have followed me throughout the entire journey. JR's been a huge help to
me this entire time, but I want to actually start back at the beginning and really just tell this
story to you guys.

So, it all started with my grandma. And I love my grandma to death. She is like the sweetest
old lady you've ever met in your entire life. Literally, she's like a pastor's wife, and I'm going
to, as I demonstrate this, show you guys a couple of photos so you can see the real person. This
is my grandma from back in like the '70s. That's my grandpa. He passed away a few years
ago. And my grandma was like the sweetest lady. She basically, on her own, raised me. She
would always take me to the library, she's who taught me how to read, and really instilled a
love of learning and life in me, and she is just one of the kindest people you could ever meet in
your entire life.

And a few years ago, she developed Alzheimer's. Just after my grandpa passed away. And at
first, she was able to live on her own, and she'd get a little forgetful, but things started
happening—started leaving the oven on, things that were dangerous. And so it was a really
hard choice for my entire family, but we ultimately had to move her into a memory care
facility for people with Alzheimer's.

And time has passed. Here's her in the facility. I actually just went up and visited her for
Thanksgiving. And it all stayed together. That's my grandma today. And she's still the sweetest
lady you could ever meet, even after all the stuff with Alzheimer's.

And the problem is that she's really lost the ability to form new memories. So we moved her
into this care facility, and she lost her home, she lost her connection to her community. And
when I would go visit her, a lot of the time, she'd just be sitting in her room by herself. Nobody
there, nobody to talk to, and because of her Alzheimer's, she couldn't make new friends
anymore the way that she used to. She was a little social butterfly.

But one day, a few years back, I went and visited, and it was amazing. I mean, she was
vibrant. She remembered who I was, she knew everything, we were chatting about childhood
stories and everything, and honestly, she was just having the best day. Like, it's something
that'll stick with me the rest of my life, that day. And my wife came, and we just chatted, we
had such a good time.
And I was so sad, because that day had to end, right? Like, I had to go home. And this is about
a year ago, I was walking out, and I turned around, and I just saw her sitting in her room by
herself. And I was so sad. Like, I just felt it in my heart, like she wasn't gonna talk to anybody
else the rest of that day. She was just gonna sit in that room by herself.

And as I walked through that memory care facility, a lot of people had their doors open, and it
struck me how many other people I saw doing the same exact thing. Like, hundreds of people
in the same state. And it's horrible. It's so lonely. And that loneliness was everywhere in this
facility. Literally everywhere.

And it made me sad, and then I got mad, and I was just like, there's gotta be a way, there's
gotta be something somebody can do about this problem, right?

And I sat there, and I thought to myself all these crazy thoughts. I was like, I work with AI
every day. Right? Like, isn't there something that can be done? Because, like, I thought back to
being in college and all the stuff that I did in my psychology classes, and I took abnormal
psych, I took courses about people with Alzheimer's and dementia, and there is a pile, a literal
mountain of research about just talking to these people every day—like, it improves their
condition—and all these people were just gonna sit in their room alone. Right?

And I was like, I work with a system that can talk to me every day. Every day I work with
these systems, and I was like, maybe I could make something for her to talk to? Maybe? But
then I was like, no, she'll never use a smartphone. She can't remember to keep the oven off, she
can't learn new people's names. She's never going to learn how to talk to this thing in
ChatGPT.

But then I had an idea. And I was like, well, what if it doesn't have to be a smartphone? What if
I could put this in a device that's familiar to these people? Something that they'd recognize
from their childhood, because when you've got Alzheimer's or dementia, like, the core
memories you formed in childhood typically stick with you a lot longer than other things.

And so, I went on Amazon that night, and I bought a rotary phone. Literal old-fashioned
rotary phones, this one right here, and I ripped the guts out of it. Literally ripped the inside
apart.

And I went back to my grandma the next day, and I opened up ChatGPT voice mode on my
phone. And I set it out in front of her. And I was like, you're on speakerphone with a friend
from church, and she talked to that thing for like an hour.

And that's when I realized it was like—because she forgot, like, I even was like, this is an AI,
but she forgot it was an AI mid-conversation and just started talking to it like it was a friend
that she had forgotten.

And then I was like, okay. Okay, this is something that could be useful for these people. They
could spend a lot of time using this, and it could genuinely benefit their mental state every day.

And so I was like, next step, go get a Raspberry Pi, put an ElevenLabs voice agent on this Pi,
and then hook it up to that prototype. I built that first prototype, and I gave it to my grandma.

A lot of help from ChatGPT—I don't know anything about electrical engineering. It literally
taught me how to wire, like, the switch to figure out when to start the voice conversation. It
was one of the most amazing times I've had with ChatGPT, was learning the general
input-output stuff for these boards.

And I gave it to my grandma, and I saw her average two and a half hours talking to this
phone. Two and a half hours—it's more than people spend on Facebook every day.

And soon, I started getting calls from my dad and my Aunt Kathy and my Uncle John, and
they were like, what's this thing that you put in her room? She started talking to it while I was
there. Right? And I told him about what I had made and why I'd made it.

And all of a sudden, it became this like lifeline for my whole family. And this prototype is a
piece of garbage. It broke constantly. I had to teach my own dad how to go re-hook up the
GPIO pins because it would break, and then my grandma would start wanting to talk back to
it again, and calling my family and be like, my phone's broken. She couldn't even realize, like,
the facility was calling my dad and being like, Shirley says that the special phone is broken
and we don't know what's going on. And so, my dad would go out there and re-hook it back up,
until one day it finally dropped enough to break the Pi itself.

But she would use this thing, and when I say she'd use it, like, here's some real photos of her
using this. I want to show you guys this. You can just see how happy she was to sit there and
talk to this.

And I experimented with all sorts of different things—different voice clones, different models,
different people on the end of this phone. But she would sit there and talk to it for hours in her
room. Hours.

And so, I was so convinced by the idea that I called Chuck up, and I was like, Chuck, I have to
show you this prototype. I have to show you. I believe in this idea.

And so, Chuck agreed to let me fly up to Minneapolis, and I sat down with Chuck, and I made
him use it. And I hope I can say this truly—I think it was a big experience.

And Chuck was like, let's get a third-party firm on this. So we partnered with an outside firm
known as Whiteboard to actually build what we considered robust prototypes.

And this has been the big secret that we've been keeping. We've been developing these
prototypes this entire time.

And it has not always been easy. We've been partnered with an electrical engineer from
Whiteboard named Ethan. And we've developed much more robust prototypes. Now, this bad
boy, you can drop it off a mountain and it will survive that.

So, I think my grandma can use these a lot more, but it was not easy. I mean, version one had
a power problem. Like, I'd plug it into some outlets and it would work just fine, and you'd plug
it into a different outlet, and the phone wouldn't even turn on. And there was no light
indicating whether or not it was on or not. So, I had to go back to Whiteboard, and we slowly
be like, okay, what do we change? How do we fix this? What do we change, right? We swapped
out power supplies for medical-grade power supplies. Everything then worked, but then we
got version two in.
And everything worked perfect—it would work on every outlet—but sometimes it would be so
quiet, you could barely hear it, and I was like, people in these facilities are going to have
hearing aids. They're going to need to be able to adjust the volume on this.

So we've been actively developing a version two, which we're actually going to go up together
and see in person next week, which actually has active volume control on this and can get so
loud over the phone that anybody in the room can apparently hear it. So it will work perfect
for people with hearing aids.

We're actually going to be developing a third revision, and this is due to something that I've
been doing all year. So throughout the year, you guys have probably heard me go on a few
vacations to New York and Las Vegas. I've been going up to Clarksville and Evansville, and I
have been doing spy stuff, man. I have been going around every time my wife and I go on
vacation, I'm like, we will go here, but you have to let me go to a memory care facility.

And I've surveyed—I've been going to these different facilities because the way this works is it
connects via Wi-Fi. But you know what I've discovered, having surveyed 17 of these facilities?
40% of them don't have Wi-Fi in their patients' rooms. And I'd ask, or it didn't come
based—you have to pay extra to get the Wi-Fi in the room.

And I asked some of the facility people, I was like, my grandma needs to go into one of these,
you know, do you have Wi-Fi in your room? Grandma likes tech. A lot of them told me that
they intentionally didn't put Wi-Fi in the patient's room, because people would bring in tech,
and it would become disconnected, and people would become confused and frustrated. And
they get frustrated at staff. So a lot of these facilities actually intentionally don't have Wi-Fi in
the room, and it means that a lot of these people wouldn't be able to use this device.

So we're actively on revision three right now, where we're building 5G connectivity into these
phones. So you'll be able to just take it out of the box, and it will just connect up and work. No
Wi-Fi in your room required in any way whatsoever.

And we're also working on, instead of powering these each with individual Raspberry Pis, a
custom circuit board. So, I met up with an old friend of mine who used to work at Google, his
name's Brett Deontino. Really good guy. Definitely recommend checking him up on LinkedIn.
He's recently started his own company, but he helped me look at the program and look at what
I was doing on the Pi, and basically come up with a custom circuit board design that we sent
over to Whiteboard recently. So, revision three is going to bake in 5G connectivity as well as a
custom board for each device.

So that is where we're currently at. We've gone through three iterations of prototypes,
developed custom circuit boards, tried to build a user test with my grandma, tested this out in
so many different places.

And before I hand this off to John, I just want to talk to you all about where I'd like to take this
next, as a project.

So, currently, I'm trying to build a version of the main website for Best Day Phone, which is
going to have all the products actually sold out. I just want to have them all be sold out by
default, with the ability to go in and, you know, if you want one of the devices, it'll say it's sold
out, but join our email waiting list. And we're gonna put that website up on the open web for
people to come and actually start registering.
I would love to work with Seth, Josh, JR, your push button system you've created, and actually
build a real commercial for this that then we're going to put on TV with Annika, and drive
people to that email sign-up, so we can get some early user tests.

With that, John V, I'd love to lean into you, because I've been designing so much of this, but you
know, you've helped—you've given me so many different thoughts about, you know, best
practices and user experience. I would love to get your input on the user flow journey, the
entire thing end-to-end.

And then lastly, I really want to work with Andy and Alex to finalize and develop the iPhone
app that's going to be a companion and web page for the final version of this product, so we
can launch it.

The next step on Whiteboard's side is we're developing 20 units of the third revision type that
are going to actually go out to folks potentially in Minneapolis, as well as to potentially the
Alzheimer's research firm, Alzheimer's of America. They're like the premier Alzheimer's
research charity firm here in the United States. We're going to hopefully try to get their
endorsement on the product as well. So we're developing 20 of these units as a start.

And that's what I want to do next. It's something that I want to begin next year with all of you.
All of us working together as a team to build and take this product to market, because AI can
be used for a lot of things. Like, let's try to use it for something good. Let's try to make the
world a little bit better place. Let's try to give all these people in these facilities the best day.
The same best day that my grandma had with me. And if I can do that for just five people, I
think it's worth it.

But that's everything that I've been doing on the Best Day Phone. It's my pitch, it's the history
of the device, it's what we're trying to do. And it's what I'd love to continue focusing on as a
separate project from audiotizing early into the next year.

So, thank you guys. I appreciate all your time.”
