# Cursor Rules — MDC File Guidelines

## What Are MDC Files?

MDC (Markdown Configuration) files store project context, rules, and guidelines that persist across AI sessions. They help maintain consistency and reduce repetitive explanations.

## Where to Create Them

All MDC files belong in:

```
[path]/best-day-phone/.cursor/rules/
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase, descriptive names
- Use `.mdc` extension
- Name by topic or domain:
  - `bdp.mdc` — Project-specific context (Best Day Phone)
  - `server.mdc` — Development server setup
  - `design.mdc` — Design system rules
  - `copy.mdc` — Copywriting guidelines

## File Structure

Every MDC file should start with frontmatter:

```yaml

```

Then use markdown for the content:
- Clear headings
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for commands
- Tables for structured data

## When to Create a New MDC File

Create a new MDC file when:
- A topic has enough depth to warrant its own file
- Information needs to persist across sessions
- Multiple rules or guidelines exist for a domain
- Setup instructions should be reusable
