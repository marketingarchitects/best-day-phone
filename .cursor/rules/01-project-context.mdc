# Best Day Phone — Project Context

## What This Is

Best Day Phone is an AI companion inside a familiar rotary phone, designed specifically for people with Alzheimer's and dementia. The form factor is intentional — people with dementia remember things from childhood most strongly, and rotary phones are iconic to that era.

## Target Audiences

### Buyer (Primary)
- **Who:** Caregivers — adult children, family members, sometimes friends
- **Pain points:** Guilt, exhaustion, inability to be there 24/7, failed tech solutions (tablets, Alexa, video frames)
- **Need:** Peace of mind, visibility into loved one's wellbeing, someone to check in when they can't

### User (Secondary)
- **Who:** Elderly person with Alzheimer's or dementia (70+)
- **Pain points:** Loneliness, confusion with modern tech, no one to talk to
- **Need:** A familiar device, zero learning curve, patient companionship

## Messaging Guidelines

### Lead With
- Empathy and emotional outcomes
- Clarity about what the product is and who it's for
- "A companion that's always there" — not "cutting-edge AI"
- Benefits, not features

### Avoid
- "Cutting-edge AI technology" (triggers skepticism)
- Leading with voice cloning (creep factor, Black Mirror vibes)
- Medical claims (FDA compliance issue)
- Technical jargon
- Gender-locked language (use "they/them" or "loved one" not "she/mom")

### Voice Cloning
- Position as **optional and secondary**
- Founder tested cloning deceased grandfather's voice — grandma started asking if he was alive
- Generic "church friend" voice worked just as well
- Frame as "add your own voice if you'd like" not "clone your voice"

## Key Stats (For Social Proof)

- **Average daily usage:** 2.5 hours (founder's grandma)
- **Longest session:** 7 hours
- **US market:** 13M (7M Alzheimer's + 6M dementia)
- **Customer lifetime:** 8–9 years (average prognosis)

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Key Differentiator |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Base (WiFi) | ~$75/month | Requires WiFi connection |
| Mid | ~$100/month | More features |
| Premium (5G) | ~$150/month | Built-in 5G, works in care facilities |

- Business model: Razor/blades — device is free, revenue from subscription
- Prices subject to change based on testing

## Regulatory Constraint

**Cannot position as a medical device** — would require FDA approval.
- Frame as "wellness companion"
- Can cite published research about isolation/loneliness
- Cannot claim device improves cognition directly

## Design Direction

- **Tone:** Warm, human, not clinical
- **Colors:** Warm cream backgrounds, rich accent colors (burgundy, forest green)
- **Typography:** Elegant serif for headlines, clean sans for body
- **Photography:** Real people, authentic moments, warm lighting
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace, let it breathe

## Reference Brands

- Agewise (senior care, warm aesthetic)
- Teitur Trophics (neurodegenerative care, clean and dignified)

## One-Sentence Pitch

> A companion that calls your loved one daily with a kind, patient voice — so they're never alone, and you can finally breathe.
